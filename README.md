Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

My first attempt at a multiplayer online game. A simple server that hosts one game of tic-tac-toe at a time, using Express with Socket.io.

Installing and Building
-----------------------

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. `npm install` to install necessary packages
1. `nodemon app.js` to start the development server
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
